# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 26 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I decided to start studying Machine Learning tomorrow. For today I searched for a course and chose Frank Kane's https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/learn/v4/overview

**Thoughts** : Good luck for me!

## Day 1 : July 27 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I prepared my environment and finished section 1 of the course.
Finally I looked at the Pandas library with more attention.

**Thoughts** : Taking the course in English will not be easy.

## Day 2 : July 28 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Statistic day! Today was a day to remember some concepts of statistics.

**Thoughts** : It was very difficult to stop and study on a Saturday.

## Day 3 : July 30 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I continue advancing in the course but without any novelty yet, just reminiscing basic concepts of probability and statistics.

**Thoughts** : Too much laziness today, I almost skipped the day.
