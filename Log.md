# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 26 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I decided to start studying Machine Learning tomorrow. For today I searched for a course and chose Frank Kane's https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/learn/v4/overview

**Thoughts** : Good luck for me!
